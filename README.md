- Function:
 [ Phase_Retrieval ] = TIE_FFT( dIdz, I0, Wavelength, tikhonov_Para, Threshold_Real, Pixel_Size )

          Input - dIdz: Imagederivate calculated by Overfocus and Underfocus images
           - I0: Onfocus image
           - Wavelength: wavelength of the light source
           - tikhonov_Para: Small constant for two purposes;
              1. To avoid zero-division problem in fourier space during FFT
                     calculation
              2. To remove low-frequency noise
          - Threshold_Real: Small constant To avoid zero-division problem in
            real space
          - Pixel_Size: A pixel size of the images ( Needed for defining sampling frequency of images)

          Output - Phase_Retrieval: Phase image by solving TIE using FFT method

-   TIE  

           eq:             Div( I0 * Grad(phase) ) = -k * dI/dz
          applied eq:     Div(Grad(phase)) = -k * dI/dz - Grad(I0)

(â€» RHS of the eq is on the in-plane region st, operators in the RHS are also in-plane operators)
